General demo programs from the [FreeDOS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freedosproject)

CCTYPE is basically the same as DOS TYPE, but prints control characters
in brackets so you can see them more easily. A good way to see if your
file has errant control characters in it.

GUESS is a "guess the number" game. The program picks a random number
from 1 to 100, and you need to guess what it is. The game tells you if
your guess is too high or too low.

SOL1 is a demonstration of how to use card suits from the DOS extended
ASCII character set. It also uses a very simple shuffling routine. (You
would not use this kind of simple shuffle in a more complicated program,
but shuffling cards isn't exactly cryptographically sensitive so it's
okay to do it here.)
