THESE ARE DEMO PROGRAMS FROM THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL

If you're just getting started with C programming, DOS is a good place
to start.  These sample programs show how you might write your own
simple replacements for common DOS commands, like ECHO, TYPE, COPY,
CHOICE, PAUSE, and MORE.

When I started as a newbie programmer in the 1990s, I learned C
programming by writing my own DOS commands, just like these.

I should add that these are *not* the best way to write these
programs. For example, reading and writing ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME is
very slow, especially on DOS. It's much faster if you use buffers. But
as a demo for how to get started in programming, this is not a bad
place to start.
